# EasyGrblSetup
GUI assistance for setting up Grbl controlled CNC machines for the first time.

## Motivation
I wrote this simple tool during the setup of my first self-build CNC router.
It is controlled by [Grbl](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki) and has several parameters to be tweaked before running smooth.
This software GUI guides you through all steps necessary to get your machine running without too much accidents.


## Platform compatibility
This software is based on Qt/C++ and should therefore run on all operation systems that supports Qt version 5.


## Features
* Cross platform
* Automatically detect up to 6 axes
* Show basic status of machine (position, status, pins, ...)
* Configure 30+ parameters in human readable form
* Provide Grbl Wiki content as tool-tip for all parameters
* Step by step guide for necessary configuration
